1. Copy and paste BN.nnkp / BN.eig / sigma_hp.log files to this directory

2. Prepare sig2wan.inp file for sig2wan.x executable. This converts your output of GW calculation file (sigma_hp.log) to wannier90 format.

********** Format of sig2wan.inp **********

sigma_hp.log             # name of GW output file
1                        # don't change this
1                        # don't change this
BN.nnkp                  # name of ".nnkp" file
BN_GW_16.eig             # name of output file which will be generated
16                       # number of bands you want to print out. This number cannot exceed the number of bands included in sigma_hp.log

3. Type "module load berkeleygw/2.1.knl"

4. Type "sig2wan.x sig2wan.inp"

5. Now you will get BN_GW_16.eig file, which contains GW eigenvalues for 12x12x6 grid / 16 bands. 

6. Let's compare this with BN.eig file generated by pw2wannier90.x. Are the number of bands same? If not, what should we do ?
