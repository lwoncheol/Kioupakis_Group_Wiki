Practice 1.

1. Let's converge ecutwfc first. Try 2x2x2 kgrid and varying ecutwfc from 30 40 50 ... 90 100. And plot total energy vs. ecutwfc. Can you see the convergence ?

2. With the converged ecutwfc value, vary kgrid from 2x2x2 3x3x3 ... 10x10x10. And plot total energy vs. k-grid. Can you see the convergence?
